Sup fellow humen （＾∀＾●）ﾉｼ,

This is my GameDev account, in which I start (and hopefully finish occasionally) game projects.

### THE GOAL / IDEOLOGY:

# MAKING ENTERTAINING MEANINGFUL GAMES

Also 
# EDUCATIONAL GAMIFICATION 
> ### (That is, gamificatin as an educational tool)

Also Also I'm not yet REALLY sure, but those are definitely the intended spirits of it.

I'm not much of anything currently (lv. 1, let's say 500xp), but that's the dream I want to make a reality, so that we all may see what games can be and where will they lead us.

### My current skills:
 - Programming (my workday profession is fullstack development)
 - Software design (I find it necessary to mention this separately)
 - Devops (Docker, pipelines etc...)

### Skills I'm developing:
 - Visual Art, specifically Pixel Art.
 - Music Composition
 - Math
 - Programming (an ever developing skill)
